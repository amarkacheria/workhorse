Code has been written in the server.js and client.js files

File package.json has been added to keep track of project dependencies and for the start script.

To run the program:
1) Navigate to ares_test directory from cmd prompt
2) Run "npm install" to install the dependencies (websocket library - "ws")
2) Run "npm start" command from the ares_test directory cmd prompt
3) You should see two node.js scripts kick off (one for server.js and one for client.js)
